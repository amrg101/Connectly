# Connectly

This project demonstrates [WebRTC protocol](https://getstream.io/glossary/webrtc-protocol/) to facilitate real-time video communications with Jetpack Compose.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate below:
- Implementing entire UI elements for real-time video communication with Jetpack Compose.
- Performing real-time communication in background with Kotlin Coroutines.
- Understanding the peer connection based on WebRTC.
- Communicating with a signaling server to exchange peer connection information between clients.
